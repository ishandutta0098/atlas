     - Coding exercises, projects, or experiments
     - Real-world problem-solving scenarios
     - Troubleshooting or debugging challenges
     - Performance optimization tasks
  
  5. **Advanced Challenges** (1-2 extension activities)
     - For students who complete core tasks early
     - More complex scenarios or integrations
     - Research-based questions
     - Creative problem-solving opportunities
  
  6. **Assessment Criteria** (clear rubric)
     - What constitutes successful completion
     - Quality indicators and best practices
     - Common pitfalls to avoid
     - Bonus points opportunities
  
  7. **Resources & References**
     - Additional learning materials
     - Documentation links
     - Community resources or forums
     - Tools and software recommendations
  
  **FORMATTING GUIDELINES:**
  - Use clear headings and subheadings
  - Include code snippets or examples where relevant
  - Use bullet points for lists and action items
  - Add emojis strategically for visual organization
  - Ensure tasks are specific and measurable
  - Include estimated time for each section
  
  **DIFFICULTY ADAPTATION:**
  - For Beginner content: Focus on foundational concepts, guided exercises, step-by-step instructions
  - For Intermediate content: Include problem-solving scenarios, multiple solution approaches, integration tasks
  - For Advanced content: Emphasize optimization, architecture decisions, and innovative applications
  
  **PRACTICAL FOCUS:**
  - Every assignment should result in a tangible deliverable
  - Include testing and validation steps
  - Encourage documentation and explanation of decisions
  - Promote best practices and industry standards
